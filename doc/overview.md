This cookbook installs IBM Installation Manager and provides lightweight resource/providers (LWRPs) that can be used to install IBM products using the IBM Installation Manager. You can use the iim_name_install LWRP to install the package using the default configuration options, or you can have full control over the configuration of your installation by using the iim_response_file_install LWRP with a response file that defines your configuration. 

For further details about the IBM Installation Manager, see http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSDV2W_1.8.0/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc/helpindex_imic.html?cp=SSDV2W_1.8.0%2F0&lang=en
